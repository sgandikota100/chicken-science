How we write [[Programs\|Programs]]. 
# High Level Languages 
These are languages that are easier for people to use. 
## Programing Languages 
Programming languages are used for wide range of applications. They typically involve compilation for direct execution by the computer's hardware (or they can be compiled to an intermediate language with an executable file which is than ran). Why use these? Well once compiled, you're program runs very fast. Note tho, they are dependent of the machine and require the extra step of compilation.

## Scripting Languages 
Scripting languages are designed to automate tasks and control the behavior of software applications using an interpreter to execute code directly, allowing for rapid development, flexibility, and ease of writing. All scripting languages are programing languages, however! Why use these? These languages can be used across any machine and run immediately (no extra step required). Note tho, it is thus slower.

## Interpretor and Compilers? 
A interpreter translates a program form high level to machine code line by line. Best for finding bugs and testing partial blocks of code. 

A compiler translates a program from high level machine code in a single operation. The original code `src` (source) is still saved and in order to run the program, it must be compiled (and compiled every time rewritten). Best for saving RAM and having fast runtime. 
# Low Level Languages
These are languages that are closer to Machine code, but still at a level that is usable by people

\* more of the lower end, but not used often in the real world; compilers can write much better low level code!
