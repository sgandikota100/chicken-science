Introduction to Computing and Programing with [[☕️ Java\|☕️ Java]]. Dive into the `1`s and `0`s all around us.  
# Chapter 1: Intro 
Computers consist of two main components: the tangible [[🏗️ Hardware\|hardware]], encompassing items like the screen, keyboard, and mouse, and the intangible [[Software\|software]](hey, click on the link! it's here to help), a set of instructions orchestrating the computer's operations. Everything you see on the computer or interact with on the computer is simply a [[Programs\|program]] that is being executed (or being run). 

This class focuses on the[[☕️ Java\|☕️ Java]] language, unique for it's compiler that allows you to "Write once, Run everywhere". Let's jump write in and write a basic program (a very world renowned one!): 

```java 
public class HelloFarm { // class 
    public static void main(String[] args) { // main method 
        System.out.println("Hello, Farm!"); // program
    }
}
```

**What does this all mean??**
In more straightforward language, envision the program as a mysterious box. It accepts a set of instructions (the Java code), performs internal operations (executing the code), and generates an outcome (displaying "Hello, World!" on the console). *A program simply receives an input and produces an output.*

As any language, there is a certain syntax and grammar rules that must be followed. For now, let's assume a class to be simply a file in which the program is held. A method is a specific entry point of the program. Don't mind too much of this yet however. The most important part is the "print statement", which is a way to display information. The curly braces indicate sections of code, while the parenthesis show the arguments to the line of code preceding it. All code (that isn't indicated a chunk of code) must end in a semicolon. And lastly a comment (or text that isn't code) can be indicated with a double forward slash. 

Note that coding isn't just about typing away; it's about understanding a sort of underlying logic. In the future, [[Algorithms\|Algorithms]] are key to effective problem solving. 

Additionally, be cautious of [[programing errors\|programing errors]]. Take your time, methodically work through your code, regularly test your program, and be aware of common mistakes. Going through your code line by line is a prudent practice. So, don't hesitate to delve into coding – it's a journey much of learning and creativity!
# Chapter 2: Variables + `Strings` 
Our `HelloFarm` program was very beautiful, but programs need to do much more than say "hello farm!". If we want to perform operations or store data, we need *variables*. 

> **Variables** store data (such as numbers and characters). The data stored is the value, which can be changed. 

There are several categories of variables, but let's start with variables considered [[primitive data\|Primitive Data types]]
```java 
int num = 5 // a whole number, 
float radius = 1.0F // a number plus a letter 
double circleArea = 5.25 // a decimal number 
char gradeForBob = "A" // a single character
```
Notice that non-numbers are in double quotes to denote that it's a letter. What about sentences? It's known as a `String`. They are unique because they are not a primitive data type (but a [[Reference data types\|Reference data types]]). Why? They can be thought of as a collection of `char`s that create a `String` (more on this a lot later). 
```java
String text = "Hello Farm!"
```

You can also use the keyword `final` to create a *constant*, or a variable that cannot be changed. It's convention to name these variables in capital letters: 
```java
final String TEXT = "Hello Farm!"
final double PI = 3.14; 
```

It's important to appropriately name variables so you can remember what they mean (`ajksfhajfk` doesn't count). 

> **Java Identifiers**: the technical term for the name of a variable. 

Some general tips: 
- First character isn't a digit 
- No space or other characters (dot, . , asterisk, * )
- identifiers are CASE SENSITIVE
- some identifiers are reserved for other purposes, such as `public`, `class`, `static` and `void` 

**Initialization** refers to the initial act of associating a value with a variable. All the the examples above are initialized variables. What happens if you have a variable as such? 
```java
int numDoggos; 
String doggoName; 
```

**Uninitialized** variables are simply one that is undefined (from the perspective of the programmer), but regardless still has a value -- just a default one. They are listed below: 
```java
int num;          // The default value is 0
double cost;      // The default value is 0.0
boolean harvest;  // The default value false
char letter;      // The default value  is '\u0000' (null character)
String name;      // The default value  null
```

To manipulate variables, we use [[Operators\|Operators]] to perform *operations* on the variables to manipulate them. operators. The simplest, as listed above can be `= <variable type>`, but operators expand to include a whole variety of types. Also note that some operators have higher precedence than others (ie like PEMDAS in math!). 

For programs that focus on creating mathematical models, the [[Math Class\|Math Class]] allows you to introduce higher orders of math (such as exponents or trigonometry). 

Aside, how do you represent decimals? For [[primitive data\|Floating-Point]] constants, you can write the digits after a decimal place, or with e Notation / scientific notation: 
- `865000000.0` is the same as `8.65e8`
- `0.000483` is the same as `4.83e-4`

Other programs that deal with characters utilize the [[String Class\|String Class]]. There are a lot of methods that work with dealing with `Strings` and modifying them. To modify printing `Strings` and other types of variables, use the methods located in the [[Print Steam Class\|Print Steam Class]] to format it. [[Escape Characters\|Escape Characters]] are also another component that help with formatting particular characters. Note, with doubles, you are not rounding when you print the variable, you are simply omitting the length of the double. This is different from [[Type Casting\|Type Casting]], which deals with compatibility (usually against different types!). 

What if we want to consider user input? The `Scanner` class is used for obtaining user input from the console. It provides methods to read different types of data, making it a versatile tool for interactive programs. 
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FarmScannerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the name of an animal on the farm: ");
        String animalName = scanner.next();

        System.out.print("Enter the number of " + animalName + "s on the farm: ");
        int animalCount = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("The farm has " + animalCount + " " + animalName + "s.");

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}

```
# Chapters 3 - 4: Flow of Control
The concept of "[[Flow of control\|flow of control]]" governs the order in which statements are executed, various logical progression of a program. In other words, code can work through different logical conditions, and depending on which is true (or false), it will execute a block of code. There are two broad categories: [[Flow of control#Branching\|branching]] and [[Flow of control#Loops\|loops]], which slightly differ in their approach. 

A note on boolean naming conventions. A common practice is to use names that reflect the purpose or condition being checked, making the code more readable. For instance, if checking whether a user is logged in, a boolean variable named `isLoggedIn` would be clearer than a generic name like `flag` or `status`. Consistent and descriptive boolean names enhance code comprehension, aiding both the developer and anyone reviewing the code.

> We can **nest** various statements or loops (literally placing one in another) to allows for more complex and finely-grained logic, with the inner statement executed based on the conditions or iterations of the outer statement -- this is known as **nesting**. 

```java
// Outer if statement checks if the dog is a puppy
        if (isPuppy) {
            System.out.println("It's a puppy!");

            // Nested if statement checks if the puppy is a small breed
            if (isSmallBreed) {
                System.out.println("It's a small breed puppy!!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("It's a large breed puppy!!");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Found another animal on the farm!");
        }
```

An example putting everything together! 
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FarmSoundsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the name of an animal on the farm: ");
        String animal = scanner.next();

        // Using string equality to determine the sound based on the entered animal
        if ("cow".equals(animal.toLowerCase())) {
            System.out.println("The cow says: Moo!");
        } else if ("dog".equals(animal.toLowerCase())) {
            System.out.println("The dog says: Woof!");
        } else if ("cat".equals(animal.toLowerCase())) {
            System.out.println("The cat says: Meow!");
        } else if ("duck".equals(animal.toLowerCase())) {
            System.out.println("The duck says: Quack!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Unknown animal or sound.");
        }

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}

```

> An `enum`, short for [[enumeration\|enumeration]], is a special data type that represents a fixed set of constants or values. 
> It provides a way to create named values for a set of related items, making the code more readable and maintainable. 

As your programs start to increase in length, it's about time to consider the importance of indentation within code. Make sure you tab brackets accordingly so that the code is readable! 
# Chapters 5 - 6: Classes & OOP
We've been arbitrarily defining a `class` up until this point. Let's dive into what it actually means for and how they can be very powerful with respect to OOP. 

[[OOP\|Object Oriented Programing]] (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," encapsulating data and behavior into reusable components. **[[Classes\|Classes]]** serve as blueprints for creating objects, allowing for the organization of code into modular and understandable structures. This approach promotes code reusability, scalability, and maintenance, as developers can model real-world entities, relationships, and actions. OOP can help build robust and flexible software systems, allowing for more maintainable, easily modifiable code. Some big takeaways: 
- a class creates an object defined by their characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods), encapsulating both data and functionality
	- Methods "invoke" or "call" a single item (aka [[Classes#Methods\|return statement]]) or nothing at all ([[Classes#Void Methods\|void method]])
	- depending on [[Classes#Visibility Modifiers\|accessibility]], you can keep some methods `public` and some `private` (don't worry about modifiers 3 and 4 in that page!)
	- `null` is a special keyword denoting the absence of a value or the lack of an object reference. Proper handling is very important 
- Classes act as blueprints for creating objects, allowing the instantiation of multiple objects with similar attributes and behaviors
- [[UML Class Diagrams\|UML (Unified Modeling Language) Class Diagrams]] visually represent the structure of classes, their relationships, and the flow of information within a system (especially with more complex code)

If we're dealing with objects now, how can we use primitive data types? That's where [[Wrapper Class\|Wrapper Class]] come in (for now, it's a side note, but it comes very handy when dealing with ADTs known as Java Collections). 
## How can I write Better Methods??
If you really want to soak in everything, check out [[CS 2340\|Objects and Design]], but at this level, it can be very overwhelming. Let's start high level: a method (in this form) should be no longer than 25 - 30 lines. They're this short because each method serves one purpose and one purpose only. Other tasks should be designated to other methods, so that you may have a method calling other methods to do different things. Yes, this can get long, but it keeps things organized so that future you and others can read code in the future (or so current you can't get lost!). 

Another common error (I have done too many times too) is to write a whole bunch of code and then test it all. Methods are often intermingled, so one base method that's broken will mess up code elsewhere. Write a method (or two if you're feeling daring) and then test it. Make sure you consider various cases, including both cases that work and cases that should not work (you might find weird things happening with these **edge cases**). 

A summary: 
- **Decompose Task into Subtasks**
- **Create Helper Methods**
- **Systematically Test with Driver Program**
- **Test Nulls, Empty Data Structures, Zeros, Arrays of Different Sizes**
# Chapter 7: Arrays and Search Algos
**[[🗃 Arrays\|Arrays]]** serve as essential data structures for organizing and manipulating collections of elements. An array is a fixed-size, contiguous memory space that stores elements of the same data type, accessed via index positions. This versatile feature facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of multiple values, making arrays fundamental in Java programming for tasks ranging from simple data storage to complex algorithm implementations.

Now considering simple arrays (1-D) of integers, what if we want to sort the items? The simplest way to do so is with a basic sorting algorithm which incudes [[Iterative Sorts#🫧 Bubble Sort\|bubble sort]] and [[Iterative Sorts#🍰 Insertion Sort\|insertion sort]]. We can also consider search algorithms (so finding a desired item rather than sorting it) through basic [[🕵️‍♀️ Search Algorithms#Linear Search\|Linear Search]] and [[🕵️‍♀️ Search Algorithms\|Binary Search]] algorithms which are a bit faster (don't feel obligated to understand time complexity yet!). For questions regarding any sorting algorithm, work through what it looks like after one or two iterations.
