# What it's all about 
Hi, I'm Sakshi. As a kid, my favorite thing in the whole world was watching brainPop videos, and then exploring those concepts (in my pee wee bitty brain) as much as I could. Sometimes it would take me into a really good book at the library, and other times some very interesting experiments done around my house. There was one thing that was always a mystery -- the ever-growing internet and how it all worked together. 

I didn't take my first computer science class till college. Why? I found other interests, but ultimately, I was lead back here. And that first class; it was actually so bad. I couldn't stand to see another line of code ever again after the final exam. I "learned" so much, none of it made sense in my brain, and the point of it seemed to be in vain. The only thing keeping me somewhat interested was understanding how cool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is. 

I gave it another shot, and it wasn't too bad. It honestly all starts with a bit of curiosity, and a whole lot of patience and work. Try and try again. And you'll see that it's about how all the chicken scraps (your random pieces of notes that make no sense) come together over time (and make sense) -- it's chicken science baby. 
# The compE journey
If ~~chicken science~~ computer science wasn't as much of a challenge itself (with no prior exposure before college lol), I decided to major in computer engineering because, fundamentally, I need to know *why* things work and not just *how*. 

And it's really cool to see a project that has a physical handheld product as well. 

So, here's the list of a few of the CS, ECE, and other relevant classes I've taken so far. If a link doesn't work, it's going to post processing (let her cook).

- [[CSCI 1301\|CSCI 1301]]: the intro class to programing in java 
- [[CSCI 1302\|CSCI 1302]]: intro to object orient programing (in java)
- [[CS 1332\|CS 1332]]: data structs and algos (in java)
- [[CS 2340\|CS 2340]]: objects and design (in java)
- [[CS 2050\|CS 2050]]: discrete mathematics 
- [[ECE 2020\|ECE 2020]]: digital systems design 
- [[ECE 2035\|ECE 2035]]: programing hw + sw systems (in MIPS and C)
