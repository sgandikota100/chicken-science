A big thank you to our [class repo](https://github.com/cs1302uga)! This whole page is based on all the notes from preparing for and attending lecture. If you're Professor Barnes, a big thank you for reminding me that this field takes a lot of patience, time, and most importantly, practice!

# Welcome to the real world
## ~~super hacking~~ command line interfaces
Now that code doesn't scare you (don't worry, even the best developers get nightmares some weird rusty crab chasing them down), lets's take a look at command line interfaces through a *terminal emulator*. Rather than opening your files (finder for all you apple people) with a graphical interface (GUI), we're going to use a text-based system: the command line interface (CLI). This allows you to more directly communicate with you computer (specifically the [[Software#OS\|Operating System]]) for applications without a GUI (such as connecting to server) and is usually much faster. How can I talk to this fancy computer (that speaks only binary)!?! 

> **Shell**: a way (another program) to take in keyboard commands and tell the OS what to do

The shell is simply another program that parses (breaks up) all the commands, arguments, and options you wrote, determines if everything is valid, executes them accordingly, displays an output, and waits for another command$^1$. Depending on your OS, you might have a slightly different shell, but most shells follow similar commands, as they were derived from a unix environment. [[🌎 Unix\|Here]] are some basic commands to familiarize yourself with it. 

Note: in this class we weren't allowed to use an IDE (integrated development environment, like VSCode or IntelliJ). And if you're in that boat, or you just want to edit code quickly, there are a few programs written to do so ([[⌨️ Emacs\|emacs]] and [[🌎 Unix#vi commands\|VIM]], to name a few). 

Without an IDE, you still need to compile and run java files. Use to following commands: 
- To compile java files: `$ javac -d bin src/Myfile.java`
- To run java files type : `$ java -cp bin FQN 
As Long as you have name (FQN!) and the class path, you can run file from any location! Remember, when you run a java file, the path (`cp`) should always point to COMPLIED code. Also specify multiple paths like this: `-cp path1:path2`.

## I have a fear of errors
^^ is that you? You see that giant blob of white message (that is like gibberish!) and now you're ready to toss your computer out the window (maybe even get on a plane and never come back). 
Well, it's not as bad as it seems. I know it's crazy but that blob was carefully written to tell you what went wrong. Once you understand [[Exception\|exceptions]], you'll realize they're actually rooting for you (yeah, go back and click on the page). 

## my computer "ate" my homework??
You're working on your homework, and perhaps, you think you messed up, so you delete a whole chunk, only to realize you need it. Or maybe it (somehow) didn't save. Now it's gone forever... unless you used something called *version control*, or a fancy way of saving older copies of code permanently. Enter [[🤖 git\|git]], a lightweight and simple way to make sure you can't blame your computer for your problems. 

# Programing big big things 
You need lots of architecture when writing massive programs (think about writing all the code for google or amazon). Going back to the basis of a few file tho, let's start one level up from classes and build on. 
## no more mess
On your laptop or your preferred online cloud storage system, you don't just dumb all your files in one place (if you do, come back when you don't). You add folders to structure to organize everything, even if it means nested folder. Likewise, we can use [[OOP#Packages\|Packages]] to add that structure to our code. Some quick reminders:
- If you're creating your own projects, declare package statements! 
- Typically import packages at the start of the file with the FQN 

## make it generic 
🚨 In progress 🚨
[[💡Generics\|💡Generics]]
## legally bound
We all see the terms and contracts page... and skip, skip, sign here, and done. One day, you wake up and realize you've consented to this, this thing, your whole live depends on and revolved around. Code (sometimes) does this too -- enter the [[Interfaces\|interface]]. 
## child support  

[[Inheritance\|Inheritance]]

## they can never know everything 
🚨 In progress 🚨
[[OOP#Visibility Modifiers for Methods\|Visibility modifiers]]

## explain your nonsense
🚨 In progress 🚨
[[UML Class Diagrams\|UML Class Diagrams]]
## "paperwork" never dies
One last thing are [[API\|API]]s! A big word for simply saying that there's a certain structure to document your code in terms of what overall methods and classes do in context of the bigger picture. Or if you're lost on how to use code that you imported, you can refer to the API to see how to use it properly.
