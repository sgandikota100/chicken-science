Escape characters are special characters preceded by a backslash (`\`) that serve as signals to the compiler to interpret the following character in a specific way. These characters insert non-printable or special characters within strings and characters, allowing developers to include newline characters (`\n`), tabs (`\t`), quotes (`\"`), and other formatting elements to enhance the readability and functionality of `Strings`, enabling the representation of characters that might otherwise be challenging to include directly. They play a key role in constructing well-formatted and expressive text within Java programs.
