*Objects and Design*

**Object Orientation** is placing data over function, information hiding, encapsulation, inheritance

# High Level Software Design Process 
Looking specifically at the design process, here is the overall approach software engineers take. 

1. Project Inception; Gather Requirements; Define actors + use cases

	- [[Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\|Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]], part of [[👸 Requirements Engineering#Object Oriented Analysis\|OOA]]
2. Model / Diagram the problem; define objects

3. Define system behaviors (Dynamic Diagrams!!)
	- [[System Sequence Diagram\|System Sequence Diagram]], part of[[👸 Requirements Engineering#Object Oriented Analysis\|OOA]]
	- [[System Diagram\|System Diagram]](most imp), part of [[👩‍🎨 Design#Object Oriented Design\|OOD]]
4. Assign object responsibilities; define interactions 
	- Object Interaction Diagrams, part of [[👩‍🎨 Design#Object Oriented Design\|OOD]]
5. Model / Diagram a potential solution
