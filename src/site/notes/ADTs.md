Abstract data types (ADTs) are an *abstract* description of a data type and its methods along with what users should expect. It doesn't tell you how the inner operations function (how the methods work) because as a user, you don't need to know that information; you just need to be able to use it. Many languages provide implemented ADT libraries. For the purpose of certain classes (looking at you [[CS 1332\|CS 1332]]), you'll need to understand the implementation (and in general it helps you know how to use it better and work with efficiency). 

Example Include: 
- [[↝ Linked Lists\|↝ Linked Lists]] (for CSCI 1302 particularly)
- [[📚 Stack + Queue ADTs\|📚 Stack + Queue ADTs]]
- [[🌴 Trees\|🌴 Trees]] 
- [[🥔 Hash maps\|🥔 Hash maps]]
- [[🚅 Skip Lists\|🚅 Skip Lists]]
- 📉 [[📈 Graph Theory#Graph ADTs\|graphs]]
