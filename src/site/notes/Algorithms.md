> [!TIP] Algorithm
> An **Algorithm** is a finite sequence of precise instruction for performing computation or for solving a problem, usually expressed in english or pseudocode. it's complete and precise 
# Properties
- **Input**: algo has input values from a specified set. 
- **output**: from each set of input values, an algo produces output values from a specified set. The output values are the solution to the problem. 
- **Definiteness**: the steps of an algo must be defined precisely
- **correctness**: An algo should produce the correct output values for each set of input values. 
- **finiteness**: and algo should produce the desired output after a finite number of steps for any input in the set
- **effectiveness**: it must be possible to perform each step of an algo exactly and in a finite amount of time 
- **generality**: the procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form not just a particular set of input values 
# Asymptotic Notations
Asymptotic notation is a way to mathematically model the runtime of the function. Let's take a look at the following notations 
- [[∞ Big-O\|∞ Big-O]] notation is a way to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime, looking at the worst case 
- [[Big-Ω\|Big-Ω]] notation is a way to describe the lower bound of an algorithm's runtime, looking at the best case 
- [[Big-Θ\|Big-Θ]] notation is a way to describe the both the upper and lower bound of an algorithm's runtime (considered the "tight bound", looking at the average case

# Complexity Of Algos
(space and time complexity!)
- remember $O(1) \neq$ 1 operation! it means same number of operations no matter what
